## Game, AR-VR Solution And Project Developer, Entrepreneur


 

My passion is creating new ideas and forging them as a developer. Biggest reward for me is see them working or solving a problem. Since 2018 running behind ideas that believed to create value. On the journey i participate several competitions and acceleration program like TUBƒ∞TAK Bigg Program and International Create Challenge ‚Äì Martigny. I‚Äôm developing games and AR-VR projects as professional programmer. My biggest tool is Unity.  

I‚Äôm a gamer as well. Playing both competitive and casual games. I have huge gaming experience on pc since Windows 95, also spend lot of time on browser games. This helps very much to creating game ideas on mobile. 

I‚Äôm proud of myself for working organized and valued this on my teammates. Love using scrum and kanban. I prefer working with compatible people to not compatible people even if they are not very good at their job. 

Private sector experience: I worked at Meyer Group as back-end and SQL developer for 1 year. Then lead a game development group (8 to 10 people)  at Doƒüu≈ü Teknoloji for 9 months; worked as a metaverse developer for 6 months as well. Then joined Magnolia Games as developer. 

Indie experience: My first published project is Bax Game on Steam. Made with unity and i was only programmer on project. Later i ranked as finalist on competition called ICC 2019 ‚Äì Martigny at Switzerland with ARRA Project. Travelled to Martigny for one month entrepreneurship marathon. Later that year i participated TUBƒ∞TAK Bigg program with ANVƒ∞L Project. Passed 2 stages then put project aside. After this project worked free-lance AR developer. Created promotion apps for companies that attending expositions. One of my project shown below. Beginning of 2022 participated TUBƒ∞TAK Bigg program again with a social project called Pedal. Passed 2 stages then put project aside. 

Now working both in private sector and own projects. Continue gaining experience, making money and solving problems.
