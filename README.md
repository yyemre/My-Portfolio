## Game, AR-VR Solution And Project Developer, Entrepreneur


 

I am a developer driven by a passion for creating new ideas and bringing them to life. For me, the greatest reward is seeing these ideas come to fruition, solving real problems, and adding value. Since 2018, I have been dedicated to pursuing ideas that I believe can make a difference. Along this journey, I have participated in several competitions and acceleration programs, including the TUBİTAK Bigg Program and the International Create Challenge (ICC) in Martigny. As a professional developer, I specialize in creating games and AR/VR projects, with Unity as my primary tool.

I’m also an avid gamer, with extensive experience across both competitive and casual gaming. My journey with PC games dates back to the days of Windows 95, and I’ve spent considerable time in browser games as well. This background has been invaluable for sparking creative ideas for mobile game development.

I take pride in my organizational skills and am committed to fostering a structured work environment for my team. I am a strong advocate of using methodologies like Scrum and Kanban to enhance productivity. When it comes to teamwork, I value compatibility and collaboration over pure technical skills.

<h4>Professional Experience</h4>

Meyer Group: I worked as a back-end and SQL developer for one year.
Doğuş Teknoloji: I led a game development team of 8-10 members for nine months and at the same time worked as a metaverse developer.
Magnolia Games: I joined as a developer and contributed to multiple projects until the studio closed.
Mind Drawer: I had worked on an industrial B2B project in three versions: an AR glasses application and mobile apps for both Android and iOS, all developed in Unity. Currently i am working on a sAIfer project that won XR Hack Istanbul. You can check it on projects section.

<h4>Independent Projects</h4>

Bax Game: My first published project on Steam, developed in Unity, where I served as the sole programmer.
ARRA Project: As a finalist in the ICC 2019 in Martigny, Switzerland, I participated in a month-long entrepreneurship marathon.
ANVIL Project: This project made it through two stages of the TUBİTAK Bigg program before I decided to set it aside.
Additionally, I have worked as a freelance AR developer, creating promotional applications for companies exhibiting at trade shows. One of these projects is showcased below.
Pedal Project: In early 2022, I re-entered the TUBİTAK Bigg program with a social initiative called Pedal, which also advanced through two stages.

Currently, I am balancing both my private sector role and independent projects, continuously expanding my experience, generating income, and finding solutions to complex problems.
